In this project, I investigated the effect of introducing spatial heterogeneity and diffusion to a bistable insect outbreak model (inspired by Ludwig et. al., 1978). 
I was able to show wave-like population dynamics by numerically solving reaction-diffusion equations with spatially-dependent parameters to simulate the response of a 
bistable system with an environmental resource gradient.
